# Combining Multiple Tables

So far we have been working with *single data frames*, which are reminiscent of single *spreadsheets/tables*. 

- However, many data projects contain *multiple tables* used together. 

- Luckily, `dplyr` gives efficient means to work with multiple tables. 

--

One family of verbs that we will use to work with multiple tables is called **mutating joins**. 

- These add new variables to one data frame from *matching observations* in another

(i) `inner_join()`

(ii) `full_join()`

(iii) `left_join()` and `right_join()`

(iv) `anti_join()`

# `nycflights13`

The `nycflights13` package contains *five data frames*, though we've mainly worked with two. 
- `flights`, `weather`, `airlines`, `airports`, `planes`

--

From *R for Data Science*:

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, dpi = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("relational_nycflights.png")
```
]

---

# Why so many data frames?

```{r}
dim(flights)
```

```{r}
head(airlines, 5)
```

Each row in `flights` is a *single flight*. 

- One variable, `carrier` is an abbreviated carrier code for each of the 336,776 departing flights. 
- It would be computationally inefficient to store the *complete airline name* in every row of `flights`. 

---

# Why so many data frames?

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(carrier, dep_delay, dest) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

While `flights` doesn't contain the complete name of each airline, it does have a **key** that links the data to the full airline names in the `airlines` data frame.

- The **key** is `carrier`, which is a shared variable between `flights` and `airlines`. 

---

# `inner_join()`

`inner_join()` will allow us to append the *full names of the airlines that managed each flight* to the main `flights` data frame. 

- To do so, we match up the *rows* in `flights` wil the rows in `airlines` that share the same *key* (`carrier`). 

```{r}
flightsJoined = flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(carrier, name, flight, origin, dest, dep_delay) 
head(flightsJoined, 5)
```

---

# `inner_join()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flightsJoined = flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(carrier, name, flight, origin, dest, dep_delay) 
```

The resulting data frame from `inner_join()` contains *only the rows that have matching key values in both tables* (`flights` and `carrier`). 
- Each row in `flights` has *exactly one* corresponding entry in `airlines`. 

```{r}
nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoined)
```

--

**Note**: *Always* check your row count after using a `_join()` function to make sure it is what you expect. 

---

# `inner_join()`

Instead of appending `carrier` names from `airlines`, let's instead append the **destination** airport names via the `airports` table (run `View(airports)`).

--

The **matching key** between the `flights` and `airports` tables are:

- `dest` (from `flights`)
- `faa` (from `airports`)

--

```{r}
flightsJoinedDest = flights %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoinedDest)
```

--

But... $329174\neq336776$! This means that there were *some* destination airports in `flights` that didn't actually appear in `airports`. 

---

# `left_join()`

We use `left_join()` when we want to include **all** rows in one table (the "left" table), and *only* rows in the other table with a matching "key" variable. 

- `right_join()` works similarly, just in the other direction. 

```{r}
flightsJoinedLeft = flights %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoinedLeft)
```

--

If a value of `dest` **does not** appear in `airports`, the `airports` columns will appear as `NA` in the left-joined table. 

---

# A Closer Inspection

We can use the `setdiff()` function to see which elements are in one vector, but not the other. 

```{r}
setdiff(flights$dest, airports$faa)
```

--

**From Google**:

`BQN`: Rafael Hernandez Airport (in Puerto Rico)

`SJU`: Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (in Puerto Rico)

`STT`: Cyril E. King Airport (in the U.S. Virgin Islands)

`PSE`: Mercedita/Ponce International Airport (in Puerto Rico)

--

This means that any flights recorded in the `flights` table that had destinations (i.e., `dest`) to any of these airports cannot be joined with the `airports` table. 

- Because these `dest` airports are not included in the `airports` table!

---

# `left_join()`

When using `left_join()` between `flights` and `airports`, the four airports *that don't appear in* `airports` **will still be included in the joined table**. 

- Their `tzone` (and all other values in `airports`) will be `NA`. 

```{r}
flights %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("LAX", "BQN", "SJU", "STT", "PSE")) %>%
  select(dest, dep_delay, name, lat, lon, tzone) %>%
  head(5)
```

---

# `right_join()`

We use `right_join()` when we want to include **all** rows in one table (the "right" table), and *only* rows in the other table with a matching "key" variable. 

- `left_join()` works similarly, just in the other direction. 

```{r}
flightsJoinedRight = flights %>%
  right_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoinedRight)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setdiff(airports$faa, flights$dest) # Too many!
```

---

# `full_join()`

`full_join()` works similarly to `inner_join()`, it just doesn't remove *any* rows. 

- If any rows from either table **DO NOT** share a matching key, those will still be included with `NA` values under the columns from the *other* table. 

```{r}
flightsJoinedFull = flights %>%
  full_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoinedFull)
```

--

This included *all* of the airports that did not appear in `flights`. 

- Since these airports were *not* destinations from NYC in 2013, their flight information includes `NA` values. 

---

# `anti_join()`

To be honest, I haven't used this one very much...it's basically the *opposite* of `inner_join()`. 

- `anti_join()` returns all rows from one table **without** a match in the other table. 

```{r}
flightsJoinedAnti = flights %>%
  anti_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

nrow(flights)
nrow(flightsJoinedAnti)
```

--

In `flightsJoinedAnti`, the **only rows kept** are the ones that have values of `dest` that do **NOT** appear in `airports`. 

---

# Putting it all together

**Let's compute the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also include information about each destination airport (i.e., the full name)**

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dest_counts = flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  rename(airport_name = name) 
```

---

# Putting it all together

**Let's compute the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also include information about each destination airport (i.e., the full name)**

1. `summarize()` calculated the *number* of flights to *each destination* (using `group_by()`)

2. `arrange()` sorted flight counts in *descending order* based on most "popular" destination

3. `left_join()` linked the airport `name` in the `airports` data frame to the summarized data frame based on the *keys* `dest` and `faa`. 
    - `NA` values were returned if a `dest` was not in `airports`

4. `rename()` renamed the `name` column to `airport_name` for clarity.
